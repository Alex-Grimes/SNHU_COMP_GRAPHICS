How do I approach designing software?

I approch it in modular way i like to break problems into bite sized chunks that can be tackled one piece at a time 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This class implemented a design mindset that was intially very difficult for me. Haveing to break everything into triangles and think of them on a virtual plane was challengeing but i feel by the end i had a decent grasp of the concept. 


What design process did you follow for your project work?

For me i like to follow the SOLID principles for software design this helps ensure that i dont have redundent code and that everything serves its own purpouse. 


How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I hope to maintain this process and principles in my current and future roles both professionally and as a student as they have led me to success so far. 


How do I approach developing programs?

I approch development just like design i use the same principles and methodolgy to try and break the work into bite sized chucks that can be accomplished rapidly to help me build momentum in the process. 


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I implemented a longer research phase then i usually need to as i struggled with alot of the principles in this course when it can to actually forming the shapes and textures the controll portion was easy to implement and understand however the 3d plane was difficult to wrap my brain around. 


How did iteration factor into your development?

I attempter to iterate and build on the previous work i have done and at some point i hope to contine on and improve upon previous itterations that i have built. 


How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I feel like after every iteration i would learn a new skill that i could build upon and improve the final product i feel like this project is just scrathcing the surface of what can be done with this software and skill set. 




How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science is critical to me reaching my goals as a developer who some day hopes to be architecting entire software solutions the principles and methodoligies of computer science are used nearly every day and help me improve my final products.


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I dont necessrily see this type of graphics and visualizations as being benifical in my few remaining courses as i do not have any classes that will utilize this skill set or aspirations after school to use this paticular skill set. 


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

This i feel is very similar to my educational path in my professional goals i do not have any plans on continuing with this type of work or specialization i find myself more drawn to web design and application design and less of this kind of work that might apply in a sepperate side of the CS field like game design.
